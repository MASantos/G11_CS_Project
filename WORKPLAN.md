# Work Plan

## Main Stages for Project Completion**
1. Create core functions which allow the program to accept connection requests, send connection requests, send text data,
   and allow the user to interface with the program through basic text commands.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Improve text parsing, so that chats can be recorded in plain text, and maybe that the program will use
a text standard. 
2. Create a "network awareness" capability. This means that the program will have a mechanism which will
allow other running programs to see that the user is online and able to revieve connection requests, and the program itself is able to make itself "known" to other users in the network. I believe i'll do this by making the program broadcast UDP packets across the network.
3. Develop a "terminal" user interface similair to the nmtui interface for network-manager. The program will now have this tui (terminal user interface), and the cui (command user interface).
4. STRETCH-GOAL: allow the program to have the ability to make servers on the network, in which one person hosts and multiple people may connect to the server. This should be implemented as a module, so people can still have the basic chat function without the code to also allow servers
5. STRETCH-GOAL: develop a gui, which like stage 4 is implemented as a module.
6. STRETCH-GOAL: maybe allow public chats i dunno.

## Daily Goals
**May 21:** 
1. get work plan file complete -- PARTIAL FAIL
2. learn basics of git -- PARTIAL FAIL
3. allow template code to use address's other then the loop back -- FAIL
**May 22:**
1. finish what was goal 1 on May 21 -- SUCCESS
2. finish what was goal 2 on May 21 -- FAIL
